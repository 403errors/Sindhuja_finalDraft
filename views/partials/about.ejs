                    <h3>History</h3>
                    Sai Arun Kiran Karthik, an Australian-trained entrepreneur, founded the first private wave energy
                    company
                    in India, Virya Paramita Energy (VPE) Private Limited, in 2020. Inspired by India's vast 40 GW wave
                    power,
                    VPE aims to foster cutting-edge technologies in sustainable energy.<br><br>
                    With Prof. Abdus Samad, a faculty
                    member in the Ocean engineering department of IIT Madras, as its driving force, VPE has gained
                    extensive
                    experience in marine energy, optimization of turbomachinery systems, computational fluid dynamics,
                    tidal
                    turbines, surrogate-based optimization, design and testing of oscillating water column and point
                    absorber
                    type wave energy converters, hydrodynamic modeling, control optimization of WECs, and artificial
                    lift. VPE
                    has a strong product innovation growth, attracting funds and technical assistance from global and
                    national
                    bodies such as the Maritime Clim Accelerator, the government of Andhra Pradesh, India, and the
                    National
                    Institute of Ocean Technology.<br><br>
                    Prof. Abhijit Chaudhuri, a faculty member in the Fluid Mechanics group at IIT Madras, has been a key
                    mentor of VPE, working on fluid mechanics and wave hydrodynamics. He is an active member of the IIT
                    Madras
                    wave energy team and has worked on tsunami wave interaction with onshore structures, explosive
                    instability
                    due to nonlinear wave mixing, and designing a wave energy-supported desalination system. VPE has
                    recently
                    signed a Joint Development Agreement with IIT Madras and incubated its startup at the Indian
                    Institute of
                    Technology, Kanpur. VPE's dynamic leadership redefining the renewable energy industry by creating
                    value
                    for customers, partners, and employees.
